Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Fentham, a PhD student at the University of Birmingham. I have interests in AI technologies and their use in security critical applications.
I'm currently focusing on Bayesian methods and Out of Distribution detection to mitigate potential attacks against AI systems.

If this sounds interesting feel free to check out my website which also has contact details: [contact me](http://dfnt.xyz/about).
